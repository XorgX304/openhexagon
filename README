NOTE: This doesn't work yet

Trying to build an open source compiler for the Hexagon DSP

== Qualcomm SDK ==

Current tools version is 8.1.05. From the document "Tools release 7.x and 8.x are based wholly on the LLVM toolchain"
If we want to support V60, we need at least version 7.

== linker issue ==

clang doesn't currently work, because it needs to "hexagon-link"

"hexagon-link" is hardcoded in line 289:
https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/Hexagon_8cpp_source.html

Qualcomm has a closed source linker "ld.qcld":

lld doesn't seem to support hexagon?
binutils bfd has no hexagon support?

There's a complete open source toolchain:
https://sourcery.mentor.com/GNUToolchain/release2800?@template=datasheet
But it's only up to Hexagon v5

CodeAurora has something:
https://portland.source.codeaurora.org/patches/quic/hexagon/
https://portland.source.codeaurora.org/patches/quic/hexagon/4.0/

Most up to date linker I've found:
https://portland.source.codeaurora.org/patches/quic/hexagon/V5/

This talks about the switch to "QCLinker" based off "MCLinker" which is open source
