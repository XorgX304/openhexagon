NOTE: This doesn't work yet

Trying to build an open source compiler for the Hexagon DSP

== linker issue ==

clang doesn't currently work, because it needs to "hexagon-link"

"hexagon-link" is hardcoded in line 289:
https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/Hexagon_8cpp_source.html

Qualcomm has a closed source linker:

lld doesn't seem to support hexagon?
binutils bfd has no hexagon support?

There's a complete open source toolchain:

But it's only up to Hexagon v5
